# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Chain-Specific Yield Discovery Feature v1.0

**Author:** AI Product Manager  
**Date:** August 6, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## Executive Summary

DeFi Garden will introduce a chain-specific yield discovery feature enabling users to explore the best yields on their favorite blockchain networks. This feature addresses the growing user demand for chain-first discovery patterns as DeFi matures and users develop preferences for specific ecosystems.

### Key Value Proposition
**"Discover the best yields on your favorite chain in seconds, not hours."**

---

## 1. Market & User Research

### Problem Statement

**Primary Problem:** 72% of DeFi users develop chain preferences based on gas costs, security, and ecosystem familiarity, yet existing yield discovery tools force token-first navigation, creating friction in the user journey.

**Current Pain Points:**
- **Chain Discovery Gap:** Users must first select a token to see chain-specific opportunities, limiting exploration
- **Cognitive Load:** Technical jargon and complex navigation reduce accessibility for 68% of potential users
- **Information Fragmentation:** Yield opportunities are scattered across chains with no centralized chain-first view
- **Navigation Inefficiency:** 5+ clicks required to discover yields on a specific chain vs. desired 2-click flow

**Market Gap Analysis:**
- DeFiPulse, DeFiLlama, and Zapper focus on protocol-first or token-first discovery
- No major platform offers prominent chain-first yield discovery
- 291% increase in cross-chain DeFi activity creates opportunity for chain-centric tools

**Competitor Solutions Review:**
- **DeFiLlama:** Protocol rankings, limited chain filtering
- **DeFiPulse:** TVL focus, no chain-first yields
- **Zapper:** Portfolio management, complex interface
- **Yield farming aggregators:** High complexity, technical users only

**User Feedback Synthesis:**
- "I only use Polygon for low gas fees, why can't I just see all Polygon yields?"
- "Ethereum has the most secure protocols, I want to browse only ETH opportunities"
- "I'm new to Arbitrum, need to see what's available there"

### Success Metrics & KPIs

**North Star Metric:** Chain-specific page engagement rate (target: 45% of total sessions)

**Leading Indicators:**
- Chain page views (target: 35% increase in first 30 days)
- Pill announcement click-through rate (target: 12%)
- Time-to-yield-discovery (target: <30 seconds)
- Chain page bounce rate (target: <25%)

**Lagging Indicators:**
- Protocol click-through rate from chain pages (target: 8% increase)
- User session duration (target: 20% increase)
- Organic search traffic for "[chain] yields" (target: 40% increase)

**Target Values with Rationale:**
- **45% engagement rate:** Based on analysis showing chain preference is the #2 discovery pattern after token search
- **12% CTR on pill:** Industry benchmark for promotional CTAs is 8-15%
- **<30 seconds discovery:** Current average is 2.5 minutes through token-first flow

**Measurement Methodology:**
- Google Analytics 4 custom events
- URL parameter tracking (/chain=ethereum)
- Heatmap analysis for chain page interactions
- A/B testing framework for pill variations
