npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### 7. Test Your Bot

## üîß Configuration

### Risk Levels

- **Level 1** üõ°Ô∏è - Very Safe: Only Aave, Compound (3-5% APY)
- **Level 2** üü¢ - Conservative: + Yearn, established DeFi (4-8% APY)  
- **Level 3** üü° - Moderate: + Some newer protocols (5-15% APY)
- **Level 4** üü† - Aggressive: Higher yield farming (10-25% APY)
- **Level 5** üî¥ - Maximum Yield: All protocols (15%+ APY)

### Auto-Deployment Safety Rules

- **TVL Minimum**: $100M+ for auto-deployment, $10M absolute minimum
- **Audit Requirement**: Only audited protocols from reputable firms
- **Gas Protection**: Transactions blocked if gas >10% of investment
- **Slippage Limits**: Configurable 0.1-5% maximum price impact

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

```
üì± Telegram Bot (Grammy)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üíæ SQLite Database (positions, transactions, settings)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîê Wallet Management (encrypted private keys)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üåê DeFi Integration (1inch + protocol-specific contracts)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Yield Optimization (DeFiLlama API + risk scoring)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ö° Real-time Monitoring (position updates, emergency alerts)
```

### Database Schema

- **Users**: Telegram user info and registration
- **Wallets**: Encrypted private keys and addresses
- **Settings**: Risk levels, slippage, auto-compound preferences
- **Positions**: Active DeFi positions with yields and performance
- **Transactions**: Complete history of zaps, harvests, and transfers

### Security Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: All private keys encrypted at rest
- **No Private Key Exposure**: Keys never logged or transmitted
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations prevent data corruption

## üîí Security Considerations

### Private Key Management
- Keys are encrypted with AES-256-CBC before storage
- Encryption key must be kept secure and never shared
- Keys are decrypted only in memory during operations
- Database access requires proper authentication

### Gas Protection
- Transactions are blocked if gas cost >10% of investment
- Users are warned about high gas periods
- Alternative chains suggested for small amounts

### Smart Contract Risks
- Only interact with audited protocols  
- TVL thresholds enforced for safety
- Emergency monitoring for protocol issues
- Users can exit positions at any time

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Setup

1. **Server Requirements**: 
   - VPS with 1GB+ RAM
   - Node.js 18+
   - SSL certificate for webhooks (optional)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   DB_PATH=/path/to/secure/database.sqlite
   WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=secure_32_char_key
   ```

3. **Process Management**:
   ```bash
   # Install PM2 for production process management
   npm install -g pm2
   
   # Start bot with PM2
   pm2 start index.ts --name defi-garden-bot
   
   # Enable auto-restart on server reboot
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

4. **Database Backup**:
   ```bash
   # Daily backup of SQLite database
   cp defi-garden.sqlite defi-garden-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sqlite
   ```

### Monitoring

- Set up alerts for database errors
- Track gas price spikes and user impact
- Monitor protocol TVL changes and alerts
