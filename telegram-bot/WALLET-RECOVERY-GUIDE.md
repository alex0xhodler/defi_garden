# Wallet Recovery and Data Loss Prevention Guide

## Incident Summary

**Date**: 2025-09-25
**Issue**: Lost access to wallet `0x3584cB73Cb524cDA9e89c72c5f12fb2c6bd1FE42` (EOA with potential USDC balance)
**Cause**: Wallet was deleted from database without proper balance verification
**Current Status**: Wallet is irrecoverable (private key not found in database, backups, or system search)

## Critical Lessons Learned

1. **Never delete wallet records without explicit balance verification**
2. **Always export private keys before any destructive operations**
3. **Implement mandatory confirmation steps for wallet operations**
4. **Create automated backups before any database modifications**

## Recommended Safeguards to Implement

### 1. Pre-deletion Balance Checks

Before any wallet deletion:
- Check all token balances (ETH, USDC, DAI, etc.)
- Check all DeFi positions
- Require explicit confirmation that balances are zero
- Log all balance information before deletion

### 2. Enhanced Confirmation Flow

```javascript
// Example confirmation flow
const confirmWalletDeletion = async (userId, walletAddress) => {
  // 1. Check balances
  const balances = await getAllTokenBalances(walletAddress);
  const positions = await getAllDeFiPositions(userId);
  
  // 2. Display balances to user
  if (hasAnyBalance(balances) || hasAnyPositions(positions)) {
    throw new Error('Cannot delete wallet with existing balances or positions');
  }
  
  // 3. Require explicit confirmation
  const confirmation = await requireExplicitConfirmation(userId);
  if (!confirmation) {
    throw new Error('Wallet deletion cancelled by user');
  }
  
  // 4. Create backup before deletion
  await createWalletBackup(userId, walletAddress);
  
  // 5. Proceed with deletion
};
```

### 3. Automated Backup Strategy

- Daily SQLite database backups with timestamps
- Backup before any destructive operations
- Store backups in secure, versioned location
- Test backup restoration process regularly

### 4. Export Safety Net

- Implement `/export` command with proper security warnings
- Require two-step confirmation for private key export
- Log export events (without logging the actual key)
- Mask private key display by default

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Safeguards

1. **Add balance verification to wallet operations**
2. **Implement confirmation prompts for destructive actions**
3. **Create backup script for database**

### Phase 2: Enhanced Safety Features

1. **Add `/export` command with security warnings**
2. **Implement automatic daily backups**
3. **Add wallet recovery tools**
4. **Create wallet migration safety checks**

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Alerts

1. **Log all wallet operations**
2. **Monitor for unusual wallet activities**
3. **Alert on potential data loss scenarios**

## Recovery Scripts Created

### check-wallet-type.js
- Checks if an address is EOA or smart contract
- Shows balance information
- Helps determine recovery feasibility

### scripts/decrypt-and-verify.js
- Safely decrypts all wallet private keys
- Verifies address derivation
- Searches for target wallet addresses

## Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Backup database
cp defi-garden.sqlite "defi-garden-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sqlite"

# Check wallet type
node check-wallet-type.js

# Verify all encrypted keys
node scripts/decrypt-and-verify.js

# Search for wallet addresses
grep -R "0x..." /path/to/search/
```

## Prevention Checklist

Before any wallet operation:
- [ ] Check all token balances
- [ ] Check all DeFi positions  
- [ ] Create database backup
- [ ] Get explicit user confirmation
- [ ] Log the operation
- [ ] Verify operation success

## Key Takeaways

1. **Data loss prevention is critical in crypto applications**
2. **Always verify before delete - crypto transactions are irreversible**
3. **Multiple confirmation steps prevent costly accidents**
4. **Backups are essential but recovery is not guaranteed**
5. **User education about private key security is paramount**
