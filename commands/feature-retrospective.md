Conduct comprehensive feature retrospective for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Analyze actual vs. predicted metrics
   | Metric | Predicted | Actual | Variance | Analysis |
   |--------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
   | Adoption Rate | 30% | 25% | -5% | Lower due to discovery issues |
   | Revenue Impact | $100K | $85K | -15% | Conversion lower than expected |
   | Support Tickets | 50/week | 75/week | +50% | Documentation gaps identified |
   | Performance | 200ms | 180ms | -10% | Better than expected |

7. Assess technical debt introduced
   ```
   Technical Debt Register:
   - Code complexity increases
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Documentation shortcuts
   - Performance optimizations deferred

   - Onboarding efficiency

9. Create improvement recommendations
   **Immediate Actions (This Sprint):**
   - Fix critical bugs
   - Update documentation
   - Improve error messages
   - Add missing tests
   
   **Short-term (Next Month):**
   - Refactor complex components
   - Enhance monitoring
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve onboarding
   
   **Long-term (Next Quarter):**
   - Architecture improvements
   - Process optimizations
   - Tool upgrades
   - Team skill development

10. Plan follow-up iterations
    Sprint planning for improvements:
    ```
    Sprint 1: Critical fixes
    - Bug fixes (8 points)
    - Documentation (5 points)
    - Quick UX improvements (5 points)
    
    Sprint 2: Enhancement
    - Performance optimization (8 points)
    - Feature discovery (5 points)
    - Testing improvements (5 points)
    
    Sprint 3: Innovation
    - New capabilities (13 points)
    - Architecture refactor (5 points)
    ```

Action Item Tracking:
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status | Impact |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Update onboarding | UX Team | Week 1 | ðŸŸ¡ | High |
| Fix performance regression | Backend | Week 1 | ðŸŸ¢ | Critical |
| Improve documentation | Tech Writer | Week 2 | ðŸ”´ | Medium |
| Add integration tests | QA Team | Week 3 | ðŸŸ¡ | High |

Success Patterns to Repeat:
- Daily standups with clear goals
- Pair programming for complex features
- Automated testing from day one
- Regular stakeholder demos
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Proactive monitoring setup
- Cross-functional planning sessions
- User feedback integration loops

Anti-patterns to Avoid:
- Skipping user research
- Rushing security reviews
- Deferring documentation
- Ignoring performance budgets
- Siloed development
- Manual deployment processes
- Reactive monitoring only
- Assumption-based decisions

Output Documents:
- retrospective_report.md with full analysis
- action_items.md with assignments
- improvement_roadmap.md with timeline
- success_patterns.md for future reference
- metrics_analysis.xlsx with data
- team_feedback_summary.md
- stakeholder_report.pdf

Follow-up Schedule:
- Week 2: Action items review
- Week 4: Metrics reassessment  
- Week 8: Impact evaluation
- Quarter end: Full reassessment
