Integrate user feedback into development for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Analyze customer support tickets
   - Categorize tickets by feature area
   - Identify recurring issues (>5 occurrences)
   - Extract pain points and frustrations
   - Analyze resolution time patterns
   - Track escalation frequency
   - Identify workaround requests
   - Map tickets to user segments
   - Calculate support cost per issue

2. Review user feedback and reviews
   - App store reviews analysis (iOS/Android)
   - Product review platforms (G2, Capterra, etc.)
   - Social media sentiment analysis
   - Forum/community discussions
   - NPS survey responses
   - User interview transcripts
   - Beta tester feedback
   - Feature request submissions

3. Identify common pain points
   - Group similar feedback themes
   - Quantify impact (# users affected)
   - Assess severity levels
   - Map to user journey stages
   - Identify root causes
   - Correlate with user segments
   - Track pain point trends
   - Calculate business impact

4. Prioritize improvements by impact
   Score each improvement by:
   - User impact (1-5): How many users affected?
   - Business value (1-5): Revenue/retention impact
   - Effort estimate (1-5): Development complexity
   - Risk level (1-5): Implementation risk
   - Strategic alignment (1-5): Fits product vision?
   
   Priority Score = (Impact × Value) / (Effort × Risk)

5. Create user stories from feedback
   ```
   As a [user type]
   I want [capability]
   So that [business value]
   
   Acceptance Criteria:
   - Given [context]
   - When [action]
   - Then [outcome]
   ```
   Include original feedback quotes
   Link to support tickets
   Add success metrics

6. Define success metrics for improvements
   - User satisfaction increase %
   - Support ticket reduction %
   - Feature adoption rate %
   - Task completion time reduction
   - Error rate decrease %
   - Revenue impact $
   - Retention improvement %
   - NPS score increase

7. Generate A/B test hypotheses
   Format:
   ```
   Hypothesis: If we [change], then [metric] will [impact] because [reasoning]
   
   Test Design:
   - Control: Current experience
   - Variant: Proposed change
   - Sample size: [calculation]
   - Duration: [timeframe]
   - Success criteria: [threshold]
   ```

8. Create feedback loop documentation
   - Feedback collection methods
   - Analysis frequency (weekly/monthly)
   - Stakeholder distribution list
   - Action item tracking
   - Implementation timeline
   - Success measurement plan
   - Communication strategy
   - Continuous improvement process

9. Plan iterative improvements
   - Quick fixes (< 1 day)
   - Sprint improvements (1-2 weeks)
   - Epic enhancements (1-3 months)
   - Strategic initiatives (3+ months)
   
   For each:
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Expected impact
   - Resource requirements

10. Set up feedback tracking system
    - Implement feedback tags/labels
    - Create feedback dashboard
    - Set up automated reports
    - Configure alert thresholds
    - Build feedback API integration
    - Establish feedback SLAs
    - Create feedback templates
    - Train team on process
