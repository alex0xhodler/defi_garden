Comprehensive risk assessment for $ARGUMENTS:

1. Technical risks (scalability, security, performance)
   - Database capacity and query performance
   - API rate limiting and throttling
   - Memory usage and resource constraints
   - Network latency and timeout handling
   - Concurrent user load capacity
   - Data consistency and race conditions
   - Security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
   - Technical debt accumulation

2. Business risks (user adoption, revenue impact)
   - User adoption resistance
   - Revenue cannibalization
   - Market timing issues
   - Competitive response
   - Customer churn potential
   - Brand reputation impact
   - Partnership dependencies
   - Regulatory compliance costs

3. Operational risks (support load, maintenance)
   - Support ticket volume increase
   - Documentation gaps
   - Training requirements
   - Monitoring blind spots
   - Incident response readiness
   - Knowledge transfer needs
   - Tool/platform dependencies
   - Vendor lock-in concerns

4. Legal/compliance risks (data privacy, regulations)
   - GDPR/CCPA compliance
   - Data residency requirements
   - Accessibility standards (WCAG)
   - Industry-specific regulations
   - Terms of service violations
   - Patent/IP infringement
   - Open source license compliance
   - Data retention policies

5. Timeline risks (dependencies, resource availability)
   - Critical path dependencies
   - Resource allocation conflicts
   - Third-party delivery delays
   - Scope creep potential
   - Testing time requirements
   - Approval process delays
   - Holiday/freeze periods
   - Team availability gaps

6. Third-party risks (API changes, service outages)
   - API deprecation schedules
   - Rate limit changes
   - Service availability SLAs
   - Data format changes
   - Authentication updates
   - Pricing model changes
   - Feature sunset risks
   - Support quality degradation

7. User experience risks (confusion, abandonment)
   - Learning curve steepness
   - Migration friction
   - Feature discovery issues
   - Performance perception
   - Mobile experience gaps
   - Accessibility barriers
   - Internationalization issues
   - Cross-browser compatibility

8. Financial risks (cost overruns, ROI)
   - Infrastructure cost escalation
   - Development timeline extension
   - Maintenance cost increase
   - Opportunity cost of delays
   - Revenue target misses
   - Customer acquisition cost increase
   - Support cost explosion
   - Technical debt interest

9. Calculate risk scores (probability × impact)
   - Use 1-5 scale for probability
   - Use 1-5 scale for impact
   - Calculate risk score (P × I)
   - Categorize as Critical (20-25), High (15-19), Medium (10-14), Low (5-9), Minimal (1-4)
   - Create risk heat map visualization
   - Prioritize by risk score

10. Create mitigation strategies for each risk
    - Preventive measures
    - Detective controls
    - Corrective actions
    - Risk transfer options
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Monitoring approach
    - Escalation procedures
    - Success metrics

Output Format:
- risk_matrix.md with RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status
- risk_mitigation_plan.md with specific actions
- risk_dashboard.html with interactive visualization
- risk_monitoring_checklist.md for ongoing tracking

Special Considerations:
- Consider cascading risks (one risk triggering others)
- Account for black swan events
- Include positive risks (opportunities)
- Update risk assessment at each milestone
- Assign risk owners for accountability
